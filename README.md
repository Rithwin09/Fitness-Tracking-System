Problem Statement:

In today’s fast-paced world, many individuals struggle to achieve their fitness goals due to a lack of personalized guidance, structured workout plans, and expert coaching. Traditional fitness programs often fail to cater to individual needs, leading to low motivation, inconsistent progress, and ineffective training. Additionally, access to professional trainers and accurate fitness tracking is often expensive or inconvenient.

Solution and complete instructions:

Overview

The Fitness Tracking System is a web-based application that helps users monitor their fitness journey, track workouts, get diet recommendations, and engage in 30-day challenges. The system also incorporates AI-based pose estimation to assist users in evaluating their exercise form using live camera feed.

Features

User Registration: Users can register by entering weight, height, and a unique ID.

BMI Calculation & Diet Recommendations: Provides personalized diet advice based on BMI.

Water Intake Suggestion: Calculates daily recommended water intake.

Exercise Tracking: Users can log gym and yoga workouts.

30-Day Challenges: Includes structured gym and yoga workout challenges.

Live Pose Estimation: AI-powered real-time posture evaluation using a webcam.

Daily Exercise Summary: Displays total workout time per day.

Technologies Used

Backend: Flask (Python)

Database: SQLite

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

AI Model: PoseNet (for real-time pose estimation)

Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.x

Flask

Flask-SQLAlchemy

TensorFlow.js (for PoseNet)

A working webcam (for AI pose estimation)


AI-Based Pose Estimation:

The AI model used in this project is PoseNet, which detects human body keypoints and evaluates posture. It is integrated using TensorFlow.js to:

Identify key body joints

Analyze user posture

Provide feedback on exercise form

How Pose Estimation Works

The webcam captures a live video feed.

PoseNet processes the video and extracts keypoints (head, shoulders, arms, legs, etc.).

A function evaluates the detected pose and provides corrective feedback based on confidence scores.

Live Camera Access

The system utilizes getUserMedia API in JavaScript to access the user's webcam:

navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true })
  .then(stream => {
    video.srcObject = stream;
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error("Error accessing camera: ", error);
  });

Deployment

You can deploy the app on platforms like Heroku or Render:
